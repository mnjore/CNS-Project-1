# DDoS attack Detection Model based on Entropy Computing
DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to network infrastructure as they can lead to service problems and potential economic losses. This project aims to detect DDoS attacks using entropy-based network traffic analysis. The model uses entropy, a measure of uncertainty or randomness, to identify unusual patterns that indicate potential attacks.
